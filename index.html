    <p class="Main Para">Welcome, dear adventurers. Our journey today is going to be trashy (quite literally). We
        will be exploring the paths of a very unwelcome travel guide, plastic.</p>
    <img class="index img2" src="Images2/Landfill.png">
    <p class="Main Para">The earth is our home. Our lives and their aspirations lie within it. We share a common
        future, one that is vulnerable to destruction due to contemporary environmental issues such as plastic
        pollution.
        Our most secure solution is leaning towards sustainability in various aspects of our world. Sustainability
        is a concept that was introduced 3 decades ago,
        due to the incline in environmental issues, especially ones induced by plastic.
        It involves the balance and development of human cooperation with natural systems through the preservation
        of ecological resources,
        development of systems to aid economic growth without damage to the future,
        evasion of activities and materials such as plastic that cause the degradation of the environment, etc.
        Sustainability can be obtained through a perfect maintenance of balance in the amount of natural production
        and utilisation of environmental and synthetic resources.
        Throughout the past, sustainability movements have been conducted to propel this cause.

        Now, let us shift the focus of our perception to the devastating impacts of plastic. The world has been
        defiled by his repercussions, and so have the individuals. Gradually dying species, and a depleting ozone
        layer, have seen an uprise, as the global water bodies are choking, strangled with the presence of this
        uninvited individual...But this, dear traveller, has strengthened our international cooperative forces and
        is continuing to strengthen us in our individual responsibility and also, in our combined efforts to
        sustainability as a globeâ€¦
