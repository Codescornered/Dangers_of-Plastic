        <p class="Main Para">Simulation 1:Marine Plastic pollution-</p>


        <p class="Main Para">Marine plastic pollution is a severe crisis faced globally in the current era. The crisis
            has been studied from the late 1960s-1970’s. Plastic is a synthetic material that was introduced during the
            industrial revolution, as a cheap, malleable and convenient source. Plastic is created utilising an
            artificial polymer (naturally occuring material found in hair and silk) made through the rearrangement of
            crude oil components, that provide plastic with its extremely useful properties. During the industrial
            revolution, this material was brought for mass production, as it did not require any manual labour and was
            available in large scales. Soon, scientists discovered that such plastic products require 500-1000 years to
            decompose, as synthetic polymer is an extremely durable material. As the consumption, utilisation and
            production of plastics became further developed in the sector of packaging, one with the requirement of high
            disposal, the situation escalated to radically impactful levels.</p>

        <img class="index img" src="Images2/Marine Pollution3.png">
        <p class="Main Para">Some other major forms of plastic utilisation that result in marine plastic pollution
            include:</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Improper disposal of packaging</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Improper disposal of plastic cutlery</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Improper disposal of plastic fibers such as single use bags</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Improper disposal of plastic bottles and caps</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Improper disposal of plastic straws</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Improper disposal of food covers</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Casting of ghost gear</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Illegal dumping of various items</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Inadequate waste management by governments</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Littering in various locations</p>
        <p class="Main Para">Contemporarily, when plastic is disposed of, it is thrown away in mass areas of garbage
            collection known as landfills. Such landfills emit environmentally hazardous chemicals and can reach
            groundwater through processes such as precipitation. The groundwater leads to streams, which subsequently
            leads to ponds, then to lakes, and rivers and ultimately to the ocean. At this point, the plastics would
            have broken down into various smaller pieces known as microplastics, through the effects of wave pressure
            and sunlight temperature, which pose higher threats to marine life. The microplastics are carried by
            slow-transitioning currents that carry approximately 1.9 million of such pieces per square meter. These same
            currents were originally proposed towards providing deep sea creatures with oxygen and nutrients.
            Microplastic contamination affects the flow of this process.</p>

        <img class="index img" src="Images2/Marine Pollution1.png">
        <p class="Main Para">he natural circular motion of the ocean leads such ocean currents containing microplastics
            into vortexes known as gyres. Improper disposal near coastal regions have greater pronity towards this.
            There are 5 major rotating ocean currents (gyres). These are the North Atlantic gyre, South Atlantic gyre,
            Indian ocean gyre, North Pacific gyre and South Pacific gyre. Each of these systems is surrounded by various
            sub-gyres that also have many levels of plastic concentration. Including all of such gyres, today, there are
            approximately 5 trillion pieces of plastic floating in the ocean.
            Some major effects of marine plastic pollution involve:</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Marine species suffocation through microplastic consumption</p>
        <p class="Main Para">Marine species entanglement in ghost gear and other </p>

        <p class="Main Para">Starvation among sea birds and fish, due to plastic’s nature of providing an illusion of
            being full</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Repercussions on human health</p>
        <img class="index img" src="Images2/Marine Pollution2.png">
        <p class="Main Para">Travelling of disease up the network of food chain</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Expensive cleaning procedures</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Accumulation of plastic on algae, causing production of foul odours that disturb flow of
            marine life</p>
