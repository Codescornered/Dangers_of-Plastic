        <h1 class="Heading">Climate Change</h1>
        <p class="Main Para">
            Climate change is a prevalent issue in the contemporary world. Global warming or climate change is a long
            term repercussion on the climatic conditions on the Earth.
            Greenhouse gases produced by human activities and utilisation of plastic products are a major contributor to
            global warming, due to effects on the density and function of the ozone layer.
            Studies have revealed that plastic production and product manufacturing industries have been among the
            leaders of greenhouse gas production.

        <p class="Main Para">The stages of this process are as follows:</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Extraction of plastic through crude oil- </p>
        <p class="Main Para">
            Primarily, crude oil is extracted from underground reservoirs utilising drilling and pumping methods. Crude
            oil is a material with great ease of extraction, as it consists of a comparatively lesser density and
            manageable temperature and pressure.
            <img class="index img2" src="Images2/Toxic3.gif">
            Such extraction can be performed in water bodies as well. This is when water at high pressure is injected
            into the reservoirs and collected into wells. Crude oil extraction has a potential risk of contaminating
            streams and groundwater (this threatens access to clean drinking water,
            and the habitats of animals) while producing emissions that can further escalate the situation of climate
            change. Extraction poses an additional risk of oil spills, which have been known to be the most devastating
            hazard to marine life.
            Production of plastic-

        <p class="Main Para">
            The crude oil is transported to necessary facilities for plastic production. Firstly, the extracted raw
            material, crude oil is refined in a furnace. The refining process can enable the creation of monomers (a
            molecule in polymers), which are a crucial element in plastic.
            The crude oil is then transported to a distillation unit, wherein the crude oil is divided into fractions,
            one of which is naphtha, a building block of plastic. Next, the monomers created are chemically bonded into
            chains and converted into higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, essentially transforming them into polymers.
            Processes known as addition polymerisation and condensation polymerisation, both requiring the aid of
            catalysts. Then, the final stage of the process- compounding begins, wherein various materials are combined
            to create the desired result of plastic. The entire process of plastic production itself creates several
            emissions
            that harm environmental sustainability and ecological balance.

            Plastic product manufacturing
        </p>
        <p class="Main Para">
            The plastic is transported from facilities to the respective industries.
            The melted plastic is injected into the necessary steel molds for the product.
            The malleability of plastic and its average melting point enables this process to go smoothly.
            The injection moulding, if done with improper machinery may lead to emission production.

            Product sale
        </p>

        <p class="Main Para">
            The plastic products are sold in the market for various purposes such as packaging and every-day objects.
            Such products are considerably cheaper than products of other materials,

            Disposal and Waste industry

        <p class="Main Para">
            The products are often disposed of and carried to landfills, where they require 500-1000 years to decompose.
            The lightweight plastic fiber products are often blown away and are scattered into drainage systems and
            water bodies. Other plastic materials that end up in the landfills are susceptible to soil degradation and
            aquatic life contamination. Often, such plastic is burned in landfills for energy production to be sent to
            homes. This decreases the volume of waste but increases the intensity of environmental impact.

        <p class="Main Para">
            Research reveals that for every ounce of PET, approximately 1 ounce of Co2 is produced. An imbalance of Co2
            in the ecosystem can prevent the formation of new ozone layer molecules in the troposphere. The reduction of
            ozone layer density can change its complete functioning of UV radiation blocking. This leaves our planet
            vulnerable to excess temperature rise, altering sea levels and gradually leading to complete ecosystem
            imbalance and a gradual end to every unadaptable species on this planet that were once key to our ecosystem.
