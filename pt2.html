        <h1 class="Heading">Animal Endangerment</h1>

        <p class="Main Para">Animal endangerment has been a serious concern since the dreadful introduction of plastic.
            More than 700 species are affected by its repercussions, and millions of organisms die at its clutch every
            year. Plastic poses a threat to the entirety of life on our planet, as its suffocating properties end up in
            every speciesâ€™ meal.</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Oceanic creatures-</p>


        <p class="Main Para">As plastics, which are broken into smaller, more hazardous pieces known as microplastics,
            various deep sea creatures are at potential risk.</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Such plastic can be discovered at shorelines, sedimented at seafloors, floating at surface
            level (if not broken down completely)or in water columns.</p>

        <p class="Main Para">The vibrant coloured nature of our plastic products attract fish that exist in such levels.
        </p>

        <p class="Main Para">Most plastic may be mistaken as plankton (a diverse collection of organisms at the base of
            the food chain which are a major source for both small and large aquatic organisms) This may lead to the
            ingestion or suffocation of the organisms after consumption of such plastic.</p>

        <p class="Main Para">As plankton is at the base of the food chain, it being mistaken can get plastic a long way
            up the food chain, and even to our plates. </p>

        <p class="Main Para">Microplastic consumption causes dysfunction of internal organs.</p>


        <p class="Main Para">Furthermore, plastic consumption provides the creatures with an illusion of being full,
            which leads to starvation. Such cases lead to death.</p>
        <img class="index img" src="Images2/Animal endangerment2.png">
        <p class="Main Para">Microplastics can absorb oceanic polluters with ease, increasing the toxic effect on marine
            life. </p>

        <p class="Main Para">Consumption of such pollution infused plastics can tamper with the health of aquatic
            creatures post reproduction.</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Researchers have discovered that micro plastic, being extremely viable for consumption, has
            reached even the polyps in underwater corals.</p>
        <p class="Main Para">Land creatures-</p>


        <p class="Main Para">Land creatures also receive a substantial level of effect from the environmental
            degradation of plastic.</p>


        <p class="Main Para">Plastic consumption by land animals can cause blockages in internal organs (especially the
            intestine), leading to fatalities</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Plastic wrapped around the limbs of such organisms can lead to higher vulnerability to
            predators due to decreased agility</p>

        <p class="Main Para">Creatures such as snakes and dogs are often found with their heads unable to move in
            improperly disposed plastic containers (often of food). This can potentially lead to suffocation.

        <p class="Main Para">Antlers and feet of animals are often affected by plastic entanglement</p>
